## Memory Match Game
# a template for building your own match games- great for studying vocabulary for tests!
these are my dist files, if you'd like the src, I can send them to you or you can see them uncompiled on [codepen](https://codepen.io/henryamster/pen/EqwZEM?editors=1100), where I built it!

The game allows for rich HTML content to be displayed in the definition of your terms, a nice feature for when you're pulling content from webpages.

Special thanks to contributors and administrators at [schema.org](https://schema.org) for their work, the included example set is derived from the [full list of types](https://schema.org/docs/full.html).

        "A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/ItemList\">ItemList</a> which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as tv, radio and games).<br/><br/>\n\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/TVSeries\">TVSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/RadioSeries\">RadioSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/MovieSeries\">MovieSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/BookSeries\">BookSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/Periodical\">Periodical</a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/VideoGameSeries\">VideoGameSeries</a>. In each case, the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/hasPart\">hasPart</a> / <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/isPartOf\">isPartOf</a> properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.<br/><br/>\n\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.",

Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).",
